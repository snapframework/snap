-- | This is the entry point for this web server application. It supports
-- easily switching between interpreting source and running statically compiled
-- code.
--
-- In either mode, the generated program should be run from the root of the
-- project tree. When it is run, it locates its templates, static content, and
-- source files in development mode, relative to the current working directory.
--
-- When compiled with the development flag, only changes to the libraries, your
-- cabal file, or this file should require a recompile to be picked up.
-- Everything else is interpreted at runtime. There are a few consequences of
-- this.
--
-- First, this is much slower. Running the interpreter takes a significant
-- chunk of time (a couple tenths of a second on the author's machine, at this
-- time), regardless of the simplicity of the loaded code. In order to
-- recompile and re-load server state as infrequently as possible, the source
-- directories are watched for updates, as are any extra directories specified
-- below.
--
-- Second, the generated server binary is MUCH larger, since it links in the
-- GHC API (via the hint library).
--
-- Third, and the reason you would ever want to actually compile with
-- development mode, is that it enables a faster development cycle. You can
-- simply edit a file, save your changes, and hit reload to see your changes
-- reflected immediately.
--
-- When this is compiled without the development flag, all the actions are
-- statically compiled in. This results in faster execution, a smaller binary
-- size, and having to recompile the server for any code change.

    -- Depending on the version of loadSnapTH in scope, this either enables
    -- dynamic reloading, or compiles it without. The last argument to

    -- trigger reloads in development mode. It doesn't need to include source
    -- directories, those are picked up automatically by the splice.

-- | This action loads the config used by this application. The loaded config
-- is returned as the first element of the tuple produced by the loadSnapTH
-- Splice. The type is not solidly fixed, though it must be an IO action that
-- produces the same type as 'getActions' takes. It also must be an instance of
-- Typeable. If the type of this is changed, a full recompile will be needed to
-- pick up the change, even in development mode.

-- production mode is in use.

-- | This function generates the the site handler and cleanup action from the
-- configuration. In production mode, this action is only run once. In
-- development mode, this action is run whenever the application is reloaded.
--
-- Development mode also makes sure that the cleanup actions are run
-- appropriately before shutdown. The cleanup action returned from loadSnapTH
-- should still be used after the server has stopped handling requests, as the
-- cleanup actions are only automatically run when a reload is triggered.
--
-- This sample doesn't actually use the config passed in, but more
-- sophisticated code might.
